    <string name="PIZZA_1_DESCRIPTION">Even a novice cook can master the art of 
            perfect pizza with our step-by-step guide. This homemade pizza recipe features a 
            simple pizza dough and toppings...</string>
    <string name="PIZZA_1_RECIPE">STEP 1\n
            Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make  
            a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden  
            spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and  
            knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the 
             dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust. \n\n
             
            STEP 2\n
            Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to  
            taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base. \n\n
             
            STEP 3\n
            Roll out the dough: if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split  
            into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm  
            across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the  
            oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets. \n\n
             
            STEP 4\n
            Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an  
            upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the  
            back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season.  
            Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake  
            for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if  
            using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.\n
            Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make  
            a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden  
            spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and  
            knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the 
             dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust. \n

    <string name="PIZZA_2_NAME"><b><i>Caramelised onion &amp; goat\'s cheese pizza</i></b></string>
    <string name="PIZZA_2_DESCRIPTION">Make a veggie pizza that\'s healthy and 
            low-fat instead of ordering a takeaway. This easy recipe uses goat\'s 
        cheese for tang while the onions give it sweetness...</string>
    <string name="PIZZA_2_RECIPE">STEP 1\n
            Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Tip the flour into a mixer with a dough hook, or a  
            bowl. Add the yeast, salt, oil and just under 100ml warm water then mix to a soft  
            dough. Knead in the food mixer for about 5 mins, but if making this by hand, tip onto  
            a work surface and knead for about 10 mins. The dough is sticky, but try not to add  
            too much extra flour. Leave in the bowl and cover with a tea towel while you make the  
            topping. There is no need to let the dough prove for a specific time – just let it sit  
            while you get on with the next step.\n\n
             
            STEP 2\n
            Tip the onions into a non-stick wok and add the oil, 4 tbsp water and balsamic vinegar. 
             Cover with a saucepan lid that sits inside the pan to help the onions soften, then  
            cook for 15 mins, stirring about 3 times and replacing the lid quickly so as not to  
            lose too much moisture. After the time is up, the onions should be golden and all the  
            liquid gone. Tip onto a plate. Add the spinach and garlic to the pan and stir-fry  
            until the spinach has wilted.\n\n
             
            STEP 3\n
            Take the dough from the bowl and cut in half with an oiled knife, then press each  
            piece into a 25-15 cm oval on a large greased baking sheet with oiled hands. Don’t  
            knead the dough first otherwise it will be too elastic and it will keep shrinking  
            back.\n\n
             
            STEP 4\n
            Spread with the spinach followed by the onions, then dot with the cheese and scatter  
            with the olives, thyme and sunflower seeds. Bake for 15 mins until golden and the  
            base is cooked through.</string>

    <string name="PIZZA_3_RECIPE">STEP 1\n
            Sift the flour into a large bowl, make a well in the middle and sprinkle in the yeast.  
            Pour 125ml water over the yeast, then flick flour over the liquid to create a layer.  
            Cover and leave to rise in a warm place for 15 mins until cracks appear on the surface  
            of that layer.\n\n
             
            STEP 2\n
            Use your hands to mix in 250ml more water along with 1 tsp salt and knead the dough  
            for about 10 mins until elastic and no longer sticky. Add a little more flour if you  
            need to. Cover and leave to rise again in a warm place for 30 mins until doubled in  
            size.\n\n
             
            STEP 3\n
            Heat the oven to as high as it will go (about 240C/220C fan/gas 9) and sprinkle one or  
            two baking trays thinly with cornmeal.\n\n
             
            STEP 4\n
            Pour boiling water from the kettle over the tomatoes, leave to stand briefly, then  
            drain and slip off the skins. Cut the tomatoes in half, cut out the stalks, scoop out  
            the seeds and discard, then chop the flesh.\n\n
             
            STEP 5\n
            Halve the chillies lengthways, cut out the stalks, seeds and white inner membrane,  
            then rinse. Cut lengthwise into fine strips, then crosswise into fine dice.\n\n
             
            STEP 6\n
            Put the tomatoes, chillies, spring onions, finely chopped parsley, beef mince, spices,  
            1 tsp salt and ½ tsp freshly ground black pepper into a bowl and mix well.\n\n
             
            STEP 7\n
            Take the dough and knead it briefly, then divide into four pieces and shape each into  
            a ball. Roll each ball into a thin circle, place on the prepared baking trays. Spread  
            with a thin layer of the meat mixture.\n\n
             
            STEP 8\n
            Bake each flatbread for 10-15 mins until the edges begin to darken. After removing  
            from the oven, sprinkle the lahmacun with the roughly chopped parsley and sliced onion, 
             then squeeze over a few drops of lemon juice. Serve straightaway.</string>

            the dough onto a work surface and knead for 10 mins until the dough feels smooth and  
            elastic, or knead using the mixer for 5 mins.\n\n
             
            STEP 2\n

            a wonderfully chewy crust. Try our margherita recipe, then customise with your  
            favourite toppings...</string>
    <string name="PIZZA_8_RECIPE">STEP 1\n
            Make a batch of our white sourdough, following the recipe to the end of step 10. When  
            the dough is ready, tip it onto a lightly floured surface and divide into six equal  
            pieces. Roll into balls and leave to rest on a floured tray, covered with a damp  
            teatowel, in the fridge for at least 4 hrs, and up to 18 hrs – the longer you leave  
            the dough, the more sour it will taste.\n\n
             
            STEP 2\n
            Meanwhile, make the tomato sauce. Drain some of the juice from the plummed tomatoes  
            and tip the rest into a bowl with the olive oil, oregano and a generous pinch of salt.  
            Combine by either scrunching everything together with your fingers (this will make  
            a chunky sauce) or blitz with a stick blender (this will make a smooth sauce). Chill  
            until needed.\n\n
             
            STEP 3\n
            To make the pizzas, heat a grill to high and prepare an ovenproof frying pan. On  
            a floured surface, push and stretch a ball of dough into a circle roughly the same  
            size as the pan. Get the pan very hot, then working quickly and carefully, drape it  
            into the pan, spread over some of the sauce, a handful of mozzarella and some basil,  
            if using.\n\n
             
            STEP 4\n
            Cook for 2 mins, until little bubbles appear, then put the pan under the grill for  
            another 2-4 mins until the sides are puffed up and the cheese has melted. Remove,  
            drizzle with a little olive oil and cut into wedges. Repeat with the remaining dough.</string>

            which is a blessing as no one wants completely raw onion on pizza).\n\n
             
            STEP 2\n
            Put the naan breads on a baking tray, sprinkle over a little water, then put in the

    <string name="PIZZA_10_RECIPE">STEP 1\n
            Tip the flour into a bowl, then stir in the yeast and 1 tsp salt. Make a well in the  
            centre and pour in 200ml warm water (make sure it’s not too hot) along with the oil.  
            Stir together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough.\n\n
             
            STEP 2\n
            Tip the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth.  
            Cover with a tea towel and set aside for an hour or so or until the dough has puffed  
            up and doubled in size. You can also leave the rough, unkneaded dough in the bowl,  
            cover with a tea towel and leave in the fridge overnight and the dough will continue  
            to prove on its own.\n\n
             
            STEP 3\n
            Meanwhile, make the tomato sauce. Put the oil in a small pan and fry the garlic

            sauce thickens a little. Leave to cool.\n\n
             
            STEP 4\n
            Once the dough has risen, knead it quickly in the bowl to knock it back, then tip out  
            onto a lightly floured surface and cut into two balls. Roll out each ball into  
            a large teardrop that is very thin and about 25cm across (teardrop shapes fit baking  
            sheets more easily than rounds).\n\n
             
            STEP 5\n
            Heat oven to 240C/220C fan/ gas 9 with a large baking sheet inside. Lift one  
            of the bases onto another floured baking sheet. Smooth the sauce over the base  
            with the back of a spoon, scatter over half the mozzarella, drizzle with olive oil  
            and season. Put the pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the hot sheet in the  
            oven and bake for 8-10 mins until crisp.</string>
